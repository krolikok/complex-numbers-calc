I have developed calulator that:
* handles complex numbers algebra, 
* an user can enter many compound operations at once (using brackets) 
* implements [normal Polish notation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Polish_notation)

It is my final project from Object Oriented Programming (Applied Computer Science).
